# MLOps Maturity Assessment Report

## 1. Documentation

### 1.1. Project Documentation

**Business goals and KPIs of ML project documented and kept up to date:**

This project excels in documenting business goals and KPIs through several key components:

- The README.md provides clear business objectives: predicting credit card defaults for financial institutions with metrics focused on cost-sensitive decision-making.
- Business metrics are formally defined in `creditrisk/core/metrics.py` with comprehensive documentation, including approval rate, default rate, and cost per decision.
- The system architecture diagram in README.md shows how the solution addresses business needs through data, training, and prediction pipelines.

**ML model risk evaluation documented:**

The model card extensively documents risk evaluation:
- "Limitations and Biases" section identifies geographic, temporal, and feature limitations
- "Potential Biases" details demographic and economic biases with explicit metrics (3.2% gender approval differential)
- Mitigations for risks are clearly documented with validation procedures, class weighting, and drift detection
- Ethical considerations and regulatory compliance (ECOA, FCRA) are thoroughly documented

### 1.2. ML Model Documentation

**Data gathering, analyzing and cleaning steps documented:**

The data preprocessing pipeline is well-documented across multiple levels:
- Code documentation in `creditrisk/core/validation.py` explains domain-specific validation rules with detailed docstrings
- Function `validate_value_ranges` documents valid ranges for each feature with business meaning
- Class-imbalance handling is documented in training code with clear rationales
- The README's "Data Pipeline" section outlines the overall data preparation strategy

**Feature definition documentation:**

Features are thoroughly documented in the model card:
- Clear categorization into demographic, credit, payment history, bill amounts, and payment amounts features
- Explicit definition of categorical feature values (e.g., payment status -2 to 8 with meaning for each value)
- Feature importance is quantified and documented using SHAP values
- Documentation shows how features are used in the model with group importance scores

**Choice of model documented and justified:**

Model selection is well-justified:
- Model card specifies CatBoost with version, architecture details, and key hyperparameters
- Optimization metrics are documented (cost-sensitive approach rather than accuracy)
- Class weighting approach is explained to address imbalance
- Training code documents hyperparameter optimization process and evaluation framework

### 1.3. Technical Documentation

**API documentation:**

While this is primarily a batch prediction system rather than real-time API, documentation includes:
- Input/output formats for prediction in the README "Prediction Pipeline" section
- Command-line interface documented in Makefile and README.md
- Explanation of prediction output format and SHAP-based explanations

**Software architecture design documented:**

The architecture is exceptionally well-documented:

- Component relationships and data flow illustrated visually
- CI/CD workflows documented with precise trigger conditions and steps

## 2. Traceability and Reproducibility

### 2.1. Infrastructure Traceability and Reproducibility

**Infrastructure defined as code:**

While not using cloud infrastructure extensively, the project defines local infrastructure components as code:
- MLflow tracking server configuration in training/prediction modules
- Directory structure generation in code with proper permissions
- Environment variables set programmatically for reproducibility
- Makefile defines build and execution processes

**IaC stored in version control:**

- All infrastructure code is included in the repository
- CI/CD workflows defined in YAML are stored in git

- Package dependencies are explicitly defined in version control

**Pull request process for IaC changes:**

The README documents the PR process:
- Fork repository, create feature branch, commit changes
- Push to branch and create a PR
- The "Contributing" section outlines this workflow

**CD pipeline applies changes automatically:**

GitHub Actions workflows automate deployments:
- `retrain_on_change.yml` automatically retrains models when code or data changes
- `predict_on_model_change.yml` automatically runs predictions when models change
- Changes are automatically committed back to the repository
- Model registry updates are automated with MLflow

**Developers cannot deploy manually:**

- Authentication and authorization via GitHub PAT ensures controlled deployments

- Branch protection is temporarily managed during CD processes
- Documentation explicitly warns against manual model deployments

**At least two environments (preprod/prod):**

- The system uses separate MLflow experiment tracking environments
- Cross-validation provides a validation environment before final training
- Champion/Challenger model approach creates effective staging

**All environments have access to production data:**

**Unambiguous lookup for any model run:**

For each model, the system tracks:
1. Code/git commit: Tagged in MLflow with `git_sha`
2. Infrastructure: Documented in MLflow run metadata
3. Environment: Captured in MLflow tags
4. ML artifacts: Stored in MLflow with proper versioning
5. Training data: Referenced in model metadata

**ML model retraining strategy present:**

The project implements a sophisticated retraining strategy:
